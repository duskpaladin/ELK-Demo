# Linux Bash Scripts #
Two sample bash scripts are included to show the material covered during our exploration of bash scriping and programming on a Linux platform. The sys_info.sh script was modified and iterated on over the course of about a week to provide a relatively simple example of how Bash scripts help cybersecurity professionals streamline the various tasks and processes needed for them to efficiently perform their duties. The for_loop.sh script is a brief script to get us familiar with loops, as well as to use that knowledge to improve the functionality of the sys_info.sh script.
